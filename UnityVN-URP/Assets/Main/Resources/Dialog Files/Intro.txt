Jacinto as Mayor "Yes, anything to find him."

    -Are you sure he disappeared?
        Mayor "Yes, no one has seen him since yesterday, I went to check his house and where the party was, he wasn't there. Today in the town we will look for him".
        <mainChar> "How many people are in the town?"
        Mayor "About 11 people counting me".
    -Do you know how or when it happened?
        Mayor "I can't tell you, earlier today I spoke with his wife and she said that she hasn't seen him since late at night, that he didn't come home."
    -Who has disappeared?
        Jacinto as Mayor "Mario disappeared, he used to live in the village, but now he lives in the city, he came to the village for the party."
        <mainChar> "How old is Mario?"
        Jacinto as Mayor "He is a man of about 37 years old and as I said before, he is married."
}

<mainChar> "I want to help you, instead of looking for Mario, tell everyone not to leave their homes and I will go to each house to ask some questions".

Mayor "Why? Wouldn't it be better to look for him now?"

<mainChar> "No, between the chaos of the search, the possible culprit could hide or disappear important clues".

Mayor "Understood, Mr. Detective, we start when you consider it convenient".
